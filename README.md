# Data Manipulation with pandas

Course offered by Datacamp - a platform for data science and artificial intelligence courses. Each Python notebook corresponds to a chapter of the course.
The material was adapted by me.

By the end of the course, the student is expected to know how to import and clean data, calculate statistics, and create visualizations.
